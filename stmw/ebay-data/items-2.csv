So far I have put up around 2000 comics and have had overwhelmingly great feedback (409 positive and 0 negative or neutral in the last month). I use ebay picture service for these auctions and many people have asked for better pictures. This is what ebay offers so if you have any questions about condition of a book, email before you bid. I am listing these comics for my 80 year old neighbors family. He recently passed away. There seems to be about twenty box and I will slowly list them all, so please keep looking. I have done some research on other auctions and people seem to price different comics differently and assign a grade. I do not know how to do this so I will start each auction at $1.00 and what you see is what you get. Please bid accordingly. All comics come in plastic bags and have cardboard boards so they are well protected. I will ship up to 5 comics priority mail for $5.00. Each 5 comics after that will be $1.10 more. I will not ship any other method as I cannot guarentee delivery with any other method. Please agree to this before bidding and do not request any other form of shipping I accept paypal, checks or money orders. Auctions must be paid for within ten days or negative feedback will be left. Anyone not satisfied with their comic may return it and I will refund the purchase price. Not the shipping so please look carefully at the scan and ask any questions first. Remember it is very important for you, the buyer, to ask any questions before you bid. I am doing the best I can to sell these at reasonable prices and I believe that any comic I list is at least worth $1.00.

There is a wooden disc in the bottom which prevents the chopping blades from hitting against the glass of the one-cup measuring cup. It has a black wooden knob on the top that is flattened in shape for comfort while chopping many portions of nuts for holiday baking. The tin lid has a retro design of black and red on ivory color. It is in excellent used condition. Shipping within US is $4.50 for Priority Mail. Outside US is usually higher so please inquire before sending payment.

This old mold is in remarkable condition considering it's age. It doesn't look like it was ever used. On the inside of the mold, there was an old recipe card for ""Coconut Lamb Cake"". The interesting thing is that most of the brands the recipe calls for are either no longer being made or are very old famous well used brands. For instance, ""Swans Down Cake Flour, Snow Frosting, and Calumet Baking Powder."" The recipe card is dated 1921. The lamb mold measures 13 and 1/2"" in length by 8"" in height. This old mold looks as if it was a promotional item for The General Foods Corporation in the 1920's promoting Bakers Coconut. The mold also has ""Baker's Coconut"" embossed at the bottom beneath the Lamb. This is a great old piece of advertising, not to mention a wonderful collectible for the culinary person! This old Lamb mold would also just be a fabulous piece to display in a country kitchen. You also have the original old recipe card that came with the mold, so there's no excuse not to put this old mold to use!! Best of all NO RESERVE . Personal checks or money orders accepted. Checks must clear before shipping. We can accept Visa and MasterCard, but only via PayPal. All items sold as is, so please be sure to ask any questions before you bid.

Hulk #4, a Stan Lee and Jack Kirby classic! This is a Good/Good+ copy. It's got lots of wear, but is still a solid copy. Both staples are still well attached, as is the centerfold. The book has a slight spine roll. The best part about this book is that the pages are supple and a GORGEOUS and SOLID off-white, as are the inside front covers! There is NO sign of color unevenness at all! Nice! This is part of a large collection I bought a while back from Showcase-New-England, and this is what they graded it, I agree, so you can be doubly sure of grading! Overstreet Guide for this book is $140.00 H A P P Y H O L I D A Y S ! The Holidays are upon us! This is an EXCELLENT gift for the comic collector you know and love, or even yourself ! ALL items PAID FOR by December 17th are GUARANTEED to ship in time for Christmas if shipped Priority! Cool, huh? GRADING: I've been collecting and selling for over 11 years...I care about comics, and condition, and I grade according to Overstreet and CGC standards. I grade strictly because I know what it's like to spend good money on a book that I REALLY wanted, only to be really disappointed when it shows up two grades lower than advertised. So, please bid with confidence! SHIPPING: Shipping will be $4.50 (isn't that crazy?) for USPS Priority Mail, or $2.50 Special Standard (Book Rate). Price includes Delivery Confirmation for both, and insurance can also be purchased. All books are shipped in sturdy packages...no point in selling nice books, and then having them damaged in shipping! And always, shipping is combined for multiple auction wins. International Bidders : I will ship the books anywhere in the world, but it gets SPENDY! I try to ship everything via Global Priority ($9US to most countries), but please note, there may be exchange and bank fees involved. I'm not making extra money, just passing on what I get charged. PAYMENT: Please DO NOT PAY until I have contacted you! This is very important, as it has led to some confusion in the past. Thank you! Hey, check out my other auctions here: Grayson's Auctions! Enjoy! The Small Print: 1. I answer ALL e-mail questions as soon as I receive them, so please do not hesitate to ask! 2. Winning bidder notifications will be sent out within 24 hours of auction's end. PLEASE READ the entire note, and pay attention to all details therein. I cannot tell you how many times I've received payments with absolutely NO identification as to what it's for, and then folks get mad when their shipment is delayed! 3. I have had an inordinate amount of non-paying bidders lately. I'm a decent and honest person, but even I get frustrated when people take advantage of me. So please, if you're not going to pay, for whatever reason, please just don't bid.

This was purchased in the 70's to go with the Antique Painted Finishes of Red, Blue, Gold and Green that Tell City featured on many items. It is pictured with the antique green and I could email you a photo of it with a gold Tell City item. Unfortunately, I do not have any red or blue finishes to photo it with. I seasonally change the upholstery on the Tell City upholstered chairs and cushioned rockers for variety. My local upholstery lady has adapted velcro to enable easy change out of the skirts. The cushioned rockers do not need any special adaptions. This 13 yards is enough to probably do at least 2 and maybe 3 Tell City chairs depending on which chairs you have. The fabric is 36 inches wide and is on a cardboard bolt. It has been in a smoke free environment. It appears to be cotton. It is difficult to find authentic fabric for the Young Republic Group in today's fabric store. The reserve is less than the per yard than the price of new cotton. $6.00 shipping for the 48 states. No handling fee on this easy to package item. Insurance extra at buyer's discretion. Payment within 10 days. The antique green bread peel is new old store stock from the same Tell City dealer and could be put on buy it now if any Ebayers are interested in it. It has the original tag and is MINT!

In 1986, a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm, revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again, with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It's been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and everything is just fine. Perfect, in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn't know is that it's a total sham. A perfectly choreographed, pretty little world where everything that's ugly, or even potentially disturbing, is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He's watched it fester to near-breaking point, and it's time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears, once and for all. It's not gonna be pretty. But at least it'll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer, more streamlined, and with a vitality that hasn't been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers, including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin, and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that's become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully, he must first return to being the World's Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World's Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller's collaborator, Lynn Varley.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).
